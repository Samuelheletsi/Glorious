    "description": "The man of God, Pastor Chris, has declared August ‘the Month of Conscious Truth’ at the Global Communion Service. Truth isn’t just what you’ve heard… it’s what you know and walk in with bold consciousness! This month, God is calling us to intentionally live out truth, not just recite it, but be fully aware of it, walk in it, and let it govern our lives. Truth that’s not conscious won’t work for you. But conscious truth changes everything!",
